This folder contains an adaptation of the Sternberg (1966, 1969a) working memory task that was written by me, Brooke Yeager, in PsychToolbox.

'TargetTrialsScript_WM' is a script needed to use the main 'SternbergWM_YeagerCode' script. 
The task is able to be run with EEG and has corresponding triggers for presentation of encoding trials, probe trials, and responses, with separate triggers sent for matched and non-matched trials. 

Output data consists of accuracy and reaction time, as well as information regarding the stimuli presented and whether trials are matched or non-matched. 
Comments within the MATLAB files can be found regarding these data points.
