This folder contains an adaptation of the Sternberg (1966, 1969a) working memory task that was written by me, Brooke Yeager, in PsychToolbox. Big thanks to Rachel Cole, PhD, a post-doc in the Narayanan Lab for helping me learn PsychToolbox and debug with me. 

'TargetTrialsScript_WM' is a script needed to use the main 'SternbergWM_YeagerCode' script. 
The task is able to be run with EEG and has corresponding triggers for presentation of encoding trials, probe trials, and responses, with separate triggers sent for matched and non-matched trials. 

Output data consists of accuracy and reaction time, as well as information regarding the stimuli presented and whether trials are matched or non-matched. 
Comments within the MATLAB files can be found regarding these data points.

This folder also contains a Sentence Comprehension task that was primarily coded by Dr. Karim Joharikhatoonabad and edited by me, Brooke Yeager, in PsycToolbox. 

This task has participants respond to whether audio-read sentences make logical sense or not. The stimuli consist of abstract action, literal action, metaphoric action, and nonsense sentences. 
These audio stimuli were obtained from Desai, R. H., Binder, J. R., Conant, L. L., Mano, Q. R., & Seidenberg, M. S. (2011). The neural career of sensory-motor metaphors. Journal of cognitive neuroscience, 23(9), 2376-2386.
You can access these audio files by reaching out the authors of that paper.

There are several informational files in this folder for this task, including 'senmet-stimuli_MAster', 'Stimuli and type', 'Stimuli'. and 'stimuli2audio'. The 'Stimuli' folder contains all audio stimuli and the 'select' folder contains audio stimuli as well. 
The actual task file is named "SentenceComprehension". 
It can be run with or without EEG recording and has triggers that identify each stimulus type (i.e., abstract, metaphoric, literal, or nonsense) and response key presses.
